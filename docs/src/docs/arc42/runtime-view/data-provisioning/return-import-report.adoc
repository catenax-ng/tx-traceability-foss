This section describes what happens when the user wants to get a report of the imported assets associated to a importJobId.

==== Overview

When a user requests an import report, TraceX-FOSS checks if the user has an adequate role ('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_SUPERVISOR').
If yes, then the endpoint returns an import report to the given importJobId.

If the importJobId is not known to Trace-X, an HTTP 404 error is returned.
