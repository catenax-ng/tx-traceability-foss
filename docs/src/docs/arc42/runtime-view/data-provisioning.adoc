= Data Provisioning

This sequence diagrams describes the process of importing data from a Trace-X Dataformat

Modul 1

Data will be imported by the Trace-X Frontend into Trace-X backend and will be persisted as asset by a Trace-X instance in a transient state.
The raw data which is needed for the shared services (DTR / EDC) will be persisted as well.
