# DISCLAIMER!
# purpose of this file is to run cypress E2E tests locally, we don't use it in other env
# because of statement above, we don't need to change settings to comply with some KICS requirements


# if you need to change image please make sure use the same version in all places
# (here and in .github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml)

# why we don't use pure browser image locally?
# because of some problems on local docker image:
# "Command was killed with SIGTRAP (Debugger breakpoint):..."
# but cypress/included:12.3.0 version base on cypress/browsers:node16.16.0-chrome107-ff107-edge
FROM cypress/included:12.3.0
